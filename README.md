# Glassmorph-page
Glassmorphism style landing page and build a complex layout that looks good on all screen sizes with HTML, CSS & JS.
Some of the things I learned from this project how to-
- Add glassmorphism effects to your website
- Create transparent text effects
- Use the 'clamp' function to make responsive text easy
- Use flexbox and absolute positioning to create some complex and unique layouts
- Make a fully functioning navbar with social media icons and make it responsive
- Make a complex layout responsive on all possible screen sizes
- Create an open/close functionality to a navbar on mobile
